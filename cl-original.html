Tolle.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*116</span> MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>This Texas federal appeal and its Georgia companion, <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton</i><i>, post,</i>
 p. 179, present constitutional challenges to state criminal abortion 
legislation. The Texas statutes under attack here are typical of those 
that have been in effect in many States for approximately a century. The
 Georgia statutes, in contrast, have a modern cast and are a legislative
 product that, to an extent at least, obviously reflects the influences 
of recent attitudinal change, of advancing medical knowledge and 
techniques, and of new thinking about an old issue.</p>
<p>We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional
 nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous opposing views, 
even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute 
convictions that the subject inspires. One's philosophy, one's 
experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's 
religious training, one's attitudes toward life and family and their 
values, and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, 
are all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions 
about abortion.</p>
<p>In addition, population growth, pollution, poverty, and racial overtones tend to complicate and not to simplify the problem.</p>
<p>Our task, of course, is to resolve the issue by constitutional 
measurement, free of emotion and of predilection. We seek earnestly to 
do this, and, because we do, we <span class="star-pagination">*117</span>
 have inquired into, and in this opinion place some emphasis upon, 
medical and medical-legal history and what that history reveals about 
man's attitudes toward the abortion procedure over the centuries. We 
bear in mind, too, Mr. Justice Holmes' admonition in his nowvindicated 
dissent in <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="96276"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/96276/lochner-v-new-york/">198 U. S. 45</a></span>, 76 (1905):</p>
<blockquote>"[The Constitution] is made for people of fundamentally 
differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions 
natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude 
our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict 
with the Constitution of the United States."</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>The Texas statutes that concern us here are Arts. 1191-1194 and 1196 of the State's Penal Code.<sup>[1]</sup> These make it a crime to "procure an abortion," as therein <span class="star-pagination">*118</span>
 defined, or to attempt one, except with respect to "an abortion 
procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the 
life of the mother." Similar statutes are in existence in a majority of 
the States.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*119</span> Texas first enacted a 
criminal abortion statute in 1854. Texas Laws 1854, c. 49, § 1, set 
forth in 3 H. Gammel, Laws of Texas 1502 (1898). This was soon modified 
into language that has remained substantially unchanged to the present 
time. See Texas Penal Code of 1857, c. 7, Arts. 531-536; G. Paschal, 
Laws of Texas, Arts. 2192-2197 (1866); Texas Rev. Stat., c. 8, Arts. 
536-541 (1879); Texas Rev. Crim. Stat., Arts. 1071-1076 (1911). The 
final article in each of these compilations provided the same exception,
 as does the present Article 1196, for an abortion by "medical advice 
for the purpose of saving the life of the mother."<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p></p>
<h2>
<span class="star-pagination">*120</span> II</h2>
<p>Jane Roe,<sup>[4]</sup> a single woman who was residing in Dallas 
County, Texas, instituted this federal action in March 1970 against the 
District Attorney of the county. She sought a declaratory judgment that 
the Texas criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional on their 
face, and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the 
statutes.</p>
<p>Roe alleged that she was unmarried and pregnant; that she wished to 
terminate her pregnancy by an abortion "performed by a competent, 
licensed physician, under safe, clinical conditions"; that she was 
unable to get a "legal" abortion in Texas because her life did not 
appear to be threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy; and that 
she could not afford to travel to another jurisdiction in order to 
secure a legal abortion under safe conditions. She claimed that the 
Texas statutes were unconstitutionally vague and that they abridged her 
right of personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth,
 and Fourteenth Amendments. By an amendment to her complaint Roe 
purported to sue "on behalf of herself and all other women" similarly 
situated.</p>
<p>James Hubert Hallford, a licensed physician, sought and was granted 
leave to intervene in Roe's action. In his complaint he alleged that he 
had been arrested previously for violations of the Texas abortion 
statutes and <span class="star-pagination">*121</span> that two such 
prosecutions were pending against him. He described conditions of 
patients who came to him seeking abortions, and he claimed that for many
 cases he, as a physician, was unable to determine whether they fell 
within or outside the exception recognized by Article 1196. He alleged 
that, as a consequence, the statutes were vague and uncertain, in 
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that they violated his own 
and his patients' rights to privacy in the doctor-patient relationship 
and his own right to practice medicine, rights he claimed were 
guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth 
Amendments.</p>
<p>John and Mary Doe,<sup>[5]</sup> a married couple, filed a companion 
complaint to that of Roe. They also named the District Attorney as 
defendant, claimed like constitutional deprivations, and sought 
declaratory and injunctive relief. The Does alleged that they were a 
childless couple; that Mrs. Doe was suffering from a "neural-chemical" 
disorder; that her physician had "advised her to avoid pregnancy until 
such time as her condition has materially improved" (although a 
pregnancy at the present time would not present "a serious risk" to her 
life); that, pursuant to medical advice, she had discontinued use of 
birth control pills; and that if she should become pregnant, she would 
want to terminate the pregnancy by an abortion performed by a competent,
 licensed physician under safe, clinical conditions. By an amendment to 
their complaint, the Does purported to sue "on behalf of themselves and 
all couples similarly situated."</p>
<p>The two actions were consolidated and heard together by a duly 
convened three-judge district court. The suits thus presented the 
situations of the pregnant single woman, the childless couple, with the 
wife not pregnant, <span class="star-pagination">*122</span> and the 
licensed practicing physician, all joining in the attack on the Texas 
criminal abortion statutes. Upon the filing of affidavits, motions were 
made for dismissal and for summary judgment. The court held that Roe and
 members of her class, and Dr. Hallford, had standing to sue and 
presented justiciable controversies, but that the Does had failed to 
allege facts sufficient to state a present controversy and did not have 
standing. It concluded that, with respect to the requests for a 
declaratory judgment, abstention was not warranted. On the merits, the 
District Court held that the "fundamental right of single women and 
married persons to choose whether to have children is protected by the 
Ninth Amendment, through the Fourteenth Amendment," and that the Texas 
criminal abortion statutes were void on their face because they were 
both unconstitutionally vague and constituted an overbroad infringement 
of the plaintiffs' Ninth Amendment rights. The court then held that 
abstention was warranted with respect to the requests for an injunction.
 It therefore dismissed the Does' complaint, declared the abortion 
statutes void, and dismissed the application for injunctive relief. <span class="citation" data-id="1472349"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1472349/roe-v-wade/">314 F. Supp. 1217</a></span>, 1225 (ND Tex. 1970).</p>
<p>The plaintiffs Roe and Doe and the intervenor Hallford, pursuant to <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. § 1253</span>,
 have appealed to this Court from that part of the District Court's 
judgment denying the injunction. The defendant District Attorney has 
purported to cross-appeal, pursuant to the same statute, from the 
court's grant of declaratory relief to Roe and Hallford. Both sides also
 have taken protective appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for
 the Fifth Circuit. That court ordered the appeals held in abeyance 
pending decision here. We postponed decision on jurisdiction to the 
hearing on the merits. <span class="citation no-link">402 U. S. 941</span> (1971).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
<span class="star-pagination">*123</span> III</h2>
<p>It might have been preferable if the defendant, pursuant to our Rule 
20, had presented to us a petition for certiorari before judgment in the
 Court of Appeals with respect to the granting of the plaintiffs' prayer
 for declaratory relief. Our decisions in <i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>Donovan,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108169"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108169/mitchell-v-donovan/">398 U.

S. 383</a></span>
 (1970), are to the effect that § 1253 does not authorize an appeal to 
this Court from the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone. We 
conclude, nevertheless, that those decisions do not foreclose our review
 of both the injunctive and the declaratory aspects of a case of this 
kind when it is properly here, as this one is, on appeal under § 1253 
from specific denial of injunctive relief, and the arguments as to both 
aspects are necessarily identical. See <i>Carter</i> v. <i>Jury Comm'n,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108026"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108026/carter-v-jury-commn-of-greene-cty/">396 U.

<p></p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>We are next confronted with issues of justiciability, standing, and 
abstention. Have Roe and the Does established that "personal stake in 
the outcome of the controversy," <i>Baker</i> v. <i>Carr,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="106366"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/">369 U. S. 186</a></span>,
 204 (1962), that insures that "the dispute sought to be adjudicated 
will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically 
viewed as capable of judicial resolution," <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107731"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107731/flast-v-cohen/">392 U.

S. 727</a></span>,
 732 (1972)? And what effect did the pendency of criminal abortion 
charges against Dr. Hallford in state court have upon the propriety of 
the federal court's granting relief to him as a plaintiff-intervenor?</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*124</span> A. <i>Jane Roe.</i> Despite
 the use of the pseudonym, no suggestion is made that Roe is a 
fictitious person. For purposes of her case, we accept as true, and as 
established, her existence; her pregnant state, as of the inception of 
her suit in March 1970 and as late as May 21 of that year when she filed
 an alias affidavit with the District Court; and her inability to obtain
 a legal abortion in Texas.</p>
<p>Viewing Roe's case as of the time of its filing and thereafter until 
as late as May, there can be little dispute that it then presented a 
case or controversy and that, wholly apart from the class aspects, she, 
as a pregnant single woman thwarted by the Texas criminal abortion laws,
 had standing to challenge those statutes. <i>Abele</i> v. <i>Markle,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="300581"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/300581/janice-abele-v-arnold-markle/">452 F. 2d 1121</a></span>, 1125 (CA2 1971); <i>Crossen</i> v. <i>Breckenridge,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="298308"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/298308/phillip-crossen-fran-pozzuto-peter-scott-pat-craddock-and-lexington/">446 F. 2d 833</a></span>, 838-839 (CA6 1971); <i>Poe</i> v. <i>Menghini,</i> <span class="citation no-link">339 F. Supp. 986</span>, 990-991 (Kan. 1972). See <i>Truax</i> v. <i>Raich,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="98542"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/98542/truax-v-raich/">239 U. S. 33</a></span>
 (1915). Indeed, we do not read the appellee's brief as really asserting
 anything to the contrary. The "logical nexus between the status 
asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated," <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107731"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107731/flast-v-cohen/">392 U. S., at 102</a></span>, and the necessary degree of contentiousness, <i>Golden</i> v. <i>Zwickler,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107868"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107868/golden-v-zwickler/">394 U. S. 103</a></span> (1969), are both present.</p>
<p>The appellee notes, however, that the record does not disclose that 
Roe was pregnant at the time of the District Court hearing on May 22, 
1970,<sup>[6]</sup> or on the following June 17 when the court's opinion
 and judgment were filed. And he suggests that Roe's case must now be 
moot because she and all other members of her class are no longer 
subject to any 1970 pregnancy.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*125</span> The usual rule in federal 
cases is that an actual controversy must exist at stages of appellate or
 certiorari review, and not simply at the date the action is initiated. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Munsingwear, Inc.,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="104822"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/104822/united-states-v-munsingwear-inc/">340 U. S. 36</a></span> (1950); <i>Golden</i> v. <i>Zwickler, <span class="citation" data-id="107868"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107868/golden-v-zwickler/">supra</a></span></i><i>; </i><i>SEC</i> v. <i>Medical Committee for Human Rights,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108424"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108424/sec-v-medical-comm-for-human-rights/">404 U. S. 403</a></span> (1972).</p>
<p>But when, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation,
 the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the 
pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is 
complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation 
seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review 
will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid. Pregnancy 
often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general 
population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy 
provides a classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness. It 
truly could be "capable of repetition, yet evading review." <i>Southern Pacific Terminal Co.</i> v. <i>ICC,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="97365"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/97365/so-pac-terminal-co-v-int-comm-comm/">219 U.

<p>We, therefore, agree with the District Court that Jane Roe had 
standing to undertake this litigation, that she presented a justiciable 
controversy, and that the termination of her 1970 pregnancy has not 
rendered her case moot.</p>
<p>B. <i>Dr. Hallford.</i> The doctor's position is different. He entered Roe's litigation as a plaintiff-intervenor, alleging in his complaint that he:</p>
<blockquote>"[I]n the past has been arrested for violating the Texas 
Abortion Laws and at the present time stands charged by indictment with 
violating said laws in the Criminal District Court of Dallas County, 
Texas to-wit: (1) The State of Texas vs. <span class="star-pagination">*126</span>
 James H. Hallford, No. C-69-5307-IH, and (2) The State of Texas vs. 
James H. Hallford, No. C-69-2524-H. In both cases the defendant is 
charged with abortion . . . ."</blockquote>
<p>In his application for leave to intervene, the doctor made like 
representations as to the abortion charges pending in the state court. 
These representations were also repeated in the affidavit he executed 
and filed in support of his motion for summary judgment.</p>
<p>Dr. Hallford is, therefore, in the position of seeking, in a federal 
court, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the same 
statutes under which he stands charged in criminal prosecutions 
simultaneously pending in state court. Although he stated that he has 
been arrested in the past for violating the State's abortion laws, he 
makes no allegation of any substantial and immediate threat to any 
federally protected right that cannot be asserted in his defense against
 the state prosecutions. Neither is there any allegation of harassment 
or bad-faith prosecution. In order to escape the rule articulated in the
 cases cited in the next paragraph of this opinion that, absent 
harassment and bad faith, a defendant in a pending state criminal case 
cannot affirmatively challenge in federal court the statutes under which
 the State is prosecuting him, Dr. Hallford seeks to distinguish his 
status as a present state defendant from his status as a "potential 
future defendant" and to assert only the latter for standing purposes 
here.</p>
<p>We see no merit in that distinction. Our decision in <i>Samuels</i> v. <i>Mackell,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108264"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108264/george-samuels-v-thomas-j-mackell-district-attorney-fred-fernandez-v/">401 U. S. 66</a></span>
 (1971), compels the conclusion that the District Court erred when it 
granted declaratory relief to Dr. Hallford instead of refraining from so
 doing. The court, of course, was correct in refusing to grant 
injunctive relief to the doctor. The reasons supportive of that action, 
however, are those expressed in <i>Samuels</i> v. <i>Mackell, supra</i><i>,</i> and in <i>Younger</i> v. <span class="star-pagination">*127</span> <i>Harris,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108263"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/">401 U. S. 37</a></span> (1971); <i>Boyle</i> v. <i>Landry,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108265"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108265/boyle-v-landry/">401 U.

S. 479</a></span> (1965). We note, in passing, that <i>Younger</i> and its companion cases were decided after the three-judge District Court decision in this case.</p>
<p>Dr. Hallford's complaint in intervention, therefore, is to be dismissed.<sup>[7]</sup>
 He is remitted to his defenses in the state criminal proceedings 
against him. We reverse the judgment of the District Court insofar as it
 granted Dr. Hallford relief and failed to dismiss his complaint in 
intervention.</p>
<p>C. <i>The Does.</i> In view of our ruling as to Roe's standing in her
 case, the issue of the Does' standing in their case has little 
significance. The claims they assert are essentially the same as those 
of Roe, and they attack the same statutes. Nevertheless, we briefly note
 the Does' posture.</p>
<p>Their pleadings present them as a childless married couple, the woman
 not being pregnant, who have no desire to have children at this time 
because of their having received medical advice that Mrs. Doe should 
avoid pregnancy, and for "other highly personal reasons." But they "fear
 . . . they may face the prospect of becoming <span class="star-pagination">*128</span>
 parents." And if pregnancy ensues, they "would want to terminate" it by
 an abortion. They assert an inability to obtain an abortion legally in 
Texas and, consequently, the prospect of obtaining an illegal abortion 
there or of going outside Texas to some place where the procedure could 
be obtained legally and competently.</p>
<p>We thus have as plaintiffs a married couple who have, as their 
asserted immediate and present injury, only an alleged "detrimental 
effect upon [their] marital happiness" because they are forced to "the 
choice of refraining from normal sexual relations or of endangering Mary
 Doe's health through a possible pregnancy." Their claim is that 
sometime in the future Mrs. Doe might become pregnant because of 
possible failure of contraceptive measures, and at that time in the 
future she might want an abortion that might then be illegal under the 
Texas statutes.</p>
<p>This very phrasing of the Does' position reveals its speculative 
character. Their alleged injury rests on possible future contraceptive 
failure, possible future pregnancy, possible future unpreparedness for 
parenthood, and possible future impairment of health. Any one or more of
 these several possibilities may not take place and all may not combine.
 In the Does' estimation, these possibilities might have some real or 
imagined impact upon their marital happiness. But we are not prepared to
 say that the bare allegation of so indirect an injury is sufficient to 
present an actual case or controversy. <i>Younger</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108263"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/">401 U.

The Does' claim falls far short of those resolved otherwise in the cases that the Does urge upon us, namely, <i>Investment Co. Institute</i> v. <i>Camp,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108300"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108300/investment-company-institute-v-camp/">401 U.

S. 150</a></span> (1970); <span class="star-pagination">*129</span> and <i>Epperson</i> v. <i>Arkansas,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107793"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107793/epperson-v-arkansas/">393 U.

S. 33</a></span> (1915).</p>
<p>The Does therefore are not appropriate plaintiffs in this litigation.
 Their complaint was properly dismissed by the District Court, and we 
affirm that dismissal.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>V</h2>
<p>The principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes is 
that they improperly invade a right, said to be possessed by the 
pregnant woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Appellant would 
discover this right in the concept of personal "liberty" embodied in the
 Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in personal, marital, 
familial, and sexual privacy said to be protected by the Bill of Rights 
or its penumbras, see <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107082"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107082/griswold-v-connecticut/">381 U.

 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Before addressing this claim, we feel it 
desirable briefly to survey, in several aspects, the history of 
abortion, for such insight as that history may afford us, and then to 
examine the state purposes and interests behind the criminal abortion 
laws.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>VI</h2>
<p>It perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive criminal
 abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively
 recent vintage. Those laws, generally proscribing abortion or its 
attempt at any time during pregnancy except when necessary to preserve 
the pregnant woman's life, are not of ancient or even of common-law 
origin. Instead, they derive from statutory changes effected, for the 
most part, in the latter half of the 19th century.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*130</span> 1. <i>Ancient attitudes.</i>
 These are not capable of precise determination. We are told that at the
 time of the Persian Empire abortifacients were known and that criminal 
abortions were severely punished.<sup>[8]</sup> We are also told, however, that abortion was practiced in Greek times as well as in the Roman Era,<sup>[9]</sup> and that "it was resorted to without scruple."<sup>[10]</sup>
 The Ephesian, Soranos, often described as the greatest of the ancient 
gynecologists, appears to have been generally opposed to Rome's 
prevailing free-abortion practices. He found it necessary to think first
 of the life of the mother, and he resorted to abortion when, upon this 
standard, he felt the procedure advisable.<sup>[11]</sup> Greek and 
Roman law afforded little protection to the unborn. If abortion was 
prosecuted in some places, it seems to have been based on a concept of a
 violation of the father's right to his offspring. Ancient religion did 
not bar abortion.<sup>[12]</sup></p>
<p>2. <i>The Hippocratic Oath.</i> What then of the famous Oath that has
 stood so long as the ethical guide of the medical profession and that 
bears the name of the great Greek (460(?)-377(?) B. C.), who has been 
described <span class="star-pagination">*131</span> as the Father of 
Medicine, the "wisest and the greatest practitioner of his art," and the
 "most important and most complete medical personality of antiquity," 
who dominated the medical schools of his time, and who typified the sum 
of the medical knowledge of the past?<sup>[13]</sup> The Oath varies 
somewhat according to the particular translation, but in any translation
 the content is clear: "I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if 
asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will not give 
to a woman a pessary to produce abortion,"<sup>[14]</sup> or "I will 
neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a
 suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give to a woman an 
abortive remedy."<sup>[15]</sup></p>
<p>Although the Oath is not mentioned in any of the principal briefs in this case or in <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton</i><i>, post,</i>
 p. 179, it represents the apex of the development of strict ethical 
concepts in medicine, and its influence endures to this day. Why did not
 the authority of Hippocrates dissuade abortion practice in his time and
 that of Rome? The late Dr. Edelstein provides us with a theory:<sup>[16]</sup>
 The Oath was not uncontested even in Hippocrates' day; only the 
Pythagorean school of philosophers frowned upon the related act of 
suicide. Most Greek thinkers, on the other hand, commended abortion, at 
least prior to viability. See Plato, Republic, V, 461; Aristotle, 
Politics, VII, 1335b 25. For the Pythagoreans, however, it was a matter 
of dogma. For them the embryo was animate from the moment of conception,
 and abortion meant destruction of a living being. The abortion clause 
of the Oath, therefore, "echoes Pythagorean doctrines," <span class="star-pagination">*132</span> and "[i]n no other stratum of Greek opinion were such views held or proposed in the same spirit of uncompromising austerity."<sup>[17]</sup></p>
<p>Dr. Edelstein then concludes that the Oath originated in a group 
representing only a small segment of Greek opinion and that it certainly
 was not accepted by all ancient physicians. He points out that medical 
writings down to Galen (A. D. 130-200) "give evidence of the violation 
of almost every one of its injunctions."<sup>[18]</sup> But with the end
 of antiquity a decided change took place. Resistance against suicide 
and against abortion became common. The Oath came to be popular. The 
emerging teachings of Christianity were in agreement with the 
Pythagorean ethic. The Oath "became the nucleus of all medical ethics" 
and "was applauded as the embodiment of truth." Thus, suggests Dr. 
Edelstein, it is "a Pythagorean manifesto and not the expression of an 
absolute standard of medical conduct."<sup>[19]</sup></p>
<p>This, it seems to us, is a satisfactory and acceptable explanation of
 the Hippocratic Oath's apparent rigidity. It enables us to understand, 
in historical context, a long-accepted and revered statement of medical 
ethics.</p>
<p>3. <i>The common law.</i> It is undisputed that at common law, abortion performed <i>before</i> "quickening" the first recognizable movement of the fetus <i>in utero,</i> appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy<sup>[20]</sup>was not an indictable offense.<sup>[21]</sup> The absence <span class="star-pagination">*133</span>
 of a common-law crime for pre-quickening abortion appears to have 
developed from a confluence of earlier philosophical, theological, and 
civil and canon law concepts of when life begins. These disciplines 
variously approached the question in terms of the point at which the 
embryo or fetus became "formed" or recognizably human, or in terms of 
when a "person" came into being, that is, infused with a "soul" or 
"animated." A loose consensus evolved in early English law that these 
events occurred at some point between conception and live birth.<sup>[22]</sup> This was "mediate animation." Although <span class="star-pagination">*134</span>
 Christian theology and the canon law came to fix the point of animation
 at 40 days for a male and 80 days for a female, a view that persisted 
until the 19th century, there was otherwise little agreement about the 
precise time of formation or animation. There was agreement, however, 
that prior to this point the fetus was to be regarded as part of the 
mother, and its destruction, therefore, was not homicide. Due to 
continued uncertainty about the precise time when animation occurred, to
 the lack of any empirical basis for the 40-80-day view, and perhaps to 
Aquinas' definition of movement as one of the two first principles of 
life, Bracton focused upon quickening as the critical point. The 
significance of quickening was echoed by later common-law scholars and 
found its way into the received common law in this country.</p>
<p>Whether abortion of a <i>quick</i> fetus was a felony at common law, 
or even a lesser crime, is still disputed. Bracton, writing early in the
 13th century, thought it homicide.<sup>[23]</sup> But the later and 
predominant view, following the great common-law scholars, has been that
 it was, at most, a lesser offense. In a frequently cited <span class="star-pagination">*135</span> passage, Coke took the position that abortion of a woman "quick with childe" is "a great misprision, and no murder."<sup>[24]</sup>
 Blackstone followed, saying that while abortion after quickening had 
once been considered manslaughter (though not murder), "modern law" took
 a less severe view.<sup>[25]</sup> A recent review of the common-law 
precedents argues, however, that those precedents contradict Coke and 
that even post-quickening abortion was never established as a common-law
 crime.<sup>[26]</sup> This is of some importance because while most 
American courts ruled, in holding or dictum, that abortion of an 
unquickened fetus was not criminal under their received common law,<sup>[27]</sup> others followed Coke in stating that abortion <span class="star-pagination">*136</span> of a quick fetus was a "misprision," a term they translated to mean "misdemeanor."<sup>[28]</sup>
 That their reliance on Coke on this aspect of the law was uncritical 
and, apparently in all the reported cases, dictum (due probably to the 
paucity of common-law prosecutions for post-quickening abortion), makes 
it now appear doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a 
common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus.</p>
<p>4. <i>The English statutory law.</i> England's first criminal 
abortion statute, Lord Ellenborough's Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, came in 
1803. It made abortion of a quick fetus, § 1, a capital crime, but in § 2
 it provided lesser penalties for the felony of abortion before 
quickening, and thus preserved the "quickening" distinction. This 
contrast was continued in the general revision of 1828, 9 Geo. 4, c. 31,
 § 13. It disappeared, however, together with the death penalty, in 
1837, <span class="citation no-link">7 Will. 4</span> &amp; 1 Vict., c. 
85. § 6, and did not reappear in the Offenses Against the Person Act of 
1861, 24 &amp; 25 Vict., c. 100, § 59, that formed the core of English 
anti-abortion law until the liberalizing reforms of 1967. In 1929, the 
Infant Life (Preservation) Act, 19 &amp; 20 Geo. 5, c. 34, came into 
being. Its emphasis was upon the destruction of "the life of a child 
capable of being born alive." It made a willful act performed with the 
necessary intent a felony. It contained a proviso that one was not to be
 <span class="star-pagination">*137</span> found guilty of the offense 
"unless it is proved that the act which caused the death of the child 
was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life 
of the mother."</p>
<p>A seemingly notable development in the English law was the case of <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Bourne,</i>
 [1939] 1 K. B. 687. This case apparently answered in the affirmative 
the question whether an abortion necessary to preserve the life of the 
pregnant woman was excepted from the criminal penalties of the 1861 Act.
 In his instructions to the jury, Judge Macnaghten referred to the 1929 
Act, and observed that that Act related to "the case where a child is 
killed by a wilful act at the time when it is being delivered in the 
ordinary course of nature." <i>Id.,</i> at 691. He concluded that the 
1861 Act's use of the word "unlawfully," imported the same meaning 
expressed by the specific proviso in the 1929 Act, even though there was
 no mention of preserving the mother's life in the 1861 Act. He then 
construed the phrase "preserving the life of the mother" broadly, that 
is, "in a reasonable sense," to include a serious and permanent threat 
to the mother's <i>health,</i> and instructed the jury to acquit Dr. 
Bourne if it found he had acted in a good-faith belief that the abortion
 was necessary for this purpose. <i>Id.,</i> at 693-694. The jury did acquit.</p>
<p>Recently, Parliament enacted a new abortion law. This is the Abortion
 Act of 1967, 15 &amp; 16 Eliz. 2, c. 87. The Act permits a licensed 
physician to perform an abortion where two other licensed physicians 
agree (a) "that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to 
the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental 
health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family, 
greater than if the pregnancy were terminated," or (b) "that there is a 
substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such 
physical or mental abnormalities as <span class="star-pagination">*138</span>
 to be seriously handicapped." The Act also provides that, in making 
this determination, "account may be taken of the pregnant woman's actual
 or reasonably foreseeable environment." It also permits a physician, 
without the concurrence of others, to terminate a pregnancy where he is 
of the good-faith opinion that the abortion "is immediately necessary to
 save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or 
mental health of the pregnant woman."</p>
<p>5. <i>The American law.</i> In this country, the law in effect in all
 but a few States until mid-19th century was the pre-existing English 
common law. Connecticut, the first State to enact abortion legislation, 
adopted in 1821 that part of Lord Ellenborough's Act that related to a 
woman "quick with child."<sup>[29]</sup> The death penalty was not imposed. Abortion before quickening was made a crime in that State only in 1860.<sup>[30]</sup> In 1828, New York enacted legislation<sup>[31]</sup>
 that, in two respects, was to serve as a model for early anti-abortion 
statutes. First, while barring destruction of an unquickened fetus as 
well as a quick fetus, it made the former only a misdemeanor, but the 
latter second-degree manslaughter. Second, it incorporated a concept of 
therapeutic abortion by providing that an abortion was excused if it 
"shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such mother, or shall
 have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for such purpose." 
By 1840, when Texas had received the common law,<sup>[32]</sup> only eight American States <span class="star-pagination">*139</span> had statutes dealing with abortion.<sup>[33]</sup>
 It was not until after the War Between the States that legislation 
began generally to replace the common law. Most of these initial 
statutes dealt severely with abortion after quickening but were lenient 
with it before quickening. Most punished attempts equally with completed
 abortions. While many statutes included the exception for an abortion 
thought by one or more physicians to be necessary to save the mother's 
life, that provision soon disappeared and the typical law required that 
the procedure actually be necessary for that purpose.</p>
<p>Gradually, in the middle and late 19th century the quickening 
distinction disappeared from the statutory law of most States and the 
degree of the offense and the penalties were increased. By the end of 
the 1950's, a large majority of the jurisdictions banned abortion, 
however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life
 of the mother.<sup>[34]</sup> The exceptions, Alabama and the District of Columbia, permitted abortion to preserve the mother's health.<sup>[35]</sup>
 Three States permitted abortions that were not "unlawfully" performed 
or that were not "without lawful justification," leaving interpretation 
of those standards to the courts.<sup>[36]</sup> In <span class="star-pagination">*140</span>
 the past several years, however, a trend toward liberalization of 
abortion statutes has resulted in adoption, by about one-third of the 
States, of less stringent laws, most of them patterned after the ALI 
Model Penal Code, § 230.3,<sup>[37]</sup> set forth as Appendix B to the opinion in <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton</i><i>, post,</i> p. 205.</p>
<p>It is thus apparent that at common law, at the time of the adoption 
of our Constitution, and throughout the major portion of the 19th 
century, abortion was viewed with less disfavor than under most American
 statutes currently in effect. Phrasing it another way, a woman enjoyed a
 substantially broader right to terminate a pregnancy than she does in 
most States today. At least with respect to the early stage of 
pregnancy, and very possibly without such a limitation, the opportunity <span class="star-pagination">*141</span>
 to make this choice was present in this country well into the 19th 
century. Even later, the law continued for some time to treat less 
punitively an abortion procured in early pregnancy.</p>
<p>6. <i>The position of the American Medical Association.</i> The 
anti-abortion mood prevalent in this country in the late 19th century 
was shared by the medical profession. Indeed, the attitude of the 
profession may have played a significant role in the enactment of 
stringent criminal abortion legislation during that period.</p>
<p>An AMA Committee on Criminal Abortion was appointed in May 1857. It 
presented its report, 12 Trans. of the Am. Med. Assn. 73-78 (1859), to 
the Twelfth Annual Meeting. That report observed that the Committee had 
been appointed to investigate criminal abortion "with a view to its 
general suppression." It deplored abortion and its frequency and it 
listed three causes of "this general demoralization":</p>
<blockquote>"The first of these causes is a wide-spread popular 
ignorance of the true character of the crime a belief, even among 
mothers themselves, that the foetus is not alive till after the period 
of quickening.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The second of the agents alluded to is the fact that the 
profession themselves are frequently supposed careless of foetal life . .
 . .</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The third reason of the frightful extent of this crime is 
found in the grave defects of our laws, both common and statute, as 
regards the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, 
as a living being. These errors, which are sufficient in most instances 
to prevent conviction, are based, and only based, upon mistaken and 
exploded medical dogmas. With strange inconsistency, the law fully 
acknowledges the foetus in utero and its inherent rights, for civil 
purposes; while personally and as criminally affected, it fails to 
recognize it, <span class="star-pagination">*142</span> and to its life as yet denies all protection." <i>Id.,</i> at 75-76.</blockquote>
<p>The Committee then offered, and the Association adopted, resolutions 
protesting "against such unwarrantable destruction of human life," 
calling upon state legislatures to revise their abortion laws, and 
requesting the cooperation of state medical societies "in pressing the 
subject." <i>Id.,</i> at 28, 78.</p>
<p>In 1871 a long and vivid report was submitted by the Committee on 
Criminal Abortion. It ended with the observation, "We had to deal with 
human life. In a matter of less importance we could entertain no 
compromise. An honest judge on the bench would call things by their 
proper names. We could do no less." 22 Trans. of the Am. Med. Assn. 258 
(1871). It proffered resolutions, adopted by the Association, <i>id.,</i>
 at 38-39, recommending, among other things, that it "be unlawful and 
unprofessional for any physician to induce abortion or premature labor, 
without the concurrent opinion of at least one respectable consulting 
physician, and then always with a view to the safety of the child if 
that be possible," and calling "the attention of the clergy of all 
denominations to the perverted views of morality entertained by a large 
class of femalesaye, and men also, on this important question."</p>
<p>Except for periodic condemnation of the criminal abortionist, no 
further formal AMA action took place until 1967. In that year, the 
Committee on Human Reproduction urged the adoption of a stated policy of
 opposition to induced abortion, except when there is "documented 
medical evidence" of a threat to the health or life of the mother, or 
that the child "may be born with incapacitating physical deformity or 
mental deficiency," or that a pregnancy "resulting from legally 
established statutory or forcible rape or incest may constitute a threat
 to the mental or physical health of the <span class="star-pagination">*143</span>
 patient," two other physicians "chosen because of their recognized 
professional competence have examined the patient and have concurred in 
writing," and the procedure "is performed in a hospital accredited by 
the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals." The providing of 
medical information by physicians to state legislatures in their 
consideration of legislation regarding therapeutic abortion was "to be 
considered consistent with the principles of ethics of the American 
Medical Association." This recommendation was adopted by the House of 
Delegates. Proceedings of the AMA House of Delegates 40-51 (June 1967).</p>
<p>In 1970, after the introduction of a variety of proposed resolutions,
 and of a report from its Board of Trustees, a reference committee noted
 "polarization of the medical profession on this controversial issue"; 
division among those who had testified; a difference of opinion among 
AMA councils and committees; "the remarkable shift in testimony" in six 
months, felt to be influenced "by the rapid changes in state laws and by
 the judicial decisions which tend to make abortion more freely 
available;" and a feeling "that this trend will continue." On June 25, 
1970, the House of Delegates adopted preambles and most of the 
resolutions proposed by the reference committee. The preambles 
emphasized "the best interests of the patient," "sound clinical 
judgment," and "informed patient consent," in contrast to "mere 
acquiescence to the patient's demand." The resolutions asserted that 
abortion is a medical procedure that should be performed by a licensed 
physician in an accredited hospital only after consultation with two 
other physicians and in conformity with state law, and that no party to 
the procedure should be required to violate personally held moral 
principles.<sup>[38]</sup> Proceedings <span class="star-pagination">*144</span> of the AMA House of Delegates 220 (June 1970). The AMA Judicial Council rendered a complementary opinion.<sup>[39]</sup></p>
<p>7. <i>The position of the American Public Health Association.</i> In October 1970, the Executive Board of the APHA adopted Standards for Abortion Services. These were five in number:</p>
<blockquote>"a. Rapid and simple abortion referral must be readily available through state and local public <span class="star-pagination">*145</span> health departments, medical societies, or other nonprofit organizations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"b. An important function of counselling should be to 
simplify and expedite the provision of abortion services; it should not 
delay the obtaining of these services.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"c. Psychiatric consultation should not be mandatory. As in 
the case of other specialized medical services, psychiatric consultation
 should be sought for definite indications and not on a routine basis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"d. A wide range of individuals from appropriately trained, 
sympathetic volunteers to highly skilled physicians may qualify as 
abortion counselors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"e. Contraception and/or sterilization should be discussed 
with each abortion patient." Recommended Standards for Abortion 
Services, 61 Am. J. Pub. Health 396 (1971).</blockquote>
<p>Among factors pertinent to life and health risks associated with abortion were three that "are recognized as important":</p>
<blockquote>"a. the skill of the physician,</blockquote>
<blockquote>"b. the environment in which the abortion is performed, and above all</blockquote>
<blockquote>"c. the duration of pregnancy, as determined by uterine size and confirmed by menstrual history." <i>Id.,</i> at 397.</blockquote>
<p>It was said that "a well-equipped hospital" offers more protection 
"to cope with unforeseen difficulties than an office or clinic without 
such resources. . . . The factor of gestational age is of overriding 
importance." Thus, it was recommended that abortions in the second 
trimester and early abortions in the presence of existing medical 
complications be performed in hospitals as inpatient procedures. For 
pregnancies in the first trimester, <span class="star-pagination">*146</span>
 abortion in the hospital with or without overnight stay "is probably 
the safest practice." An abortion in an extramural facility, however, is
 an acceptable alternative "provided arrangements exist in advance to 
admit patients promptly if unforeseen complications develop." Standards 
for an abortion facility were listed. It was said that at present 
abortions should be performed by physicians or osteopaths who are 
licensed to practice and who have "adequate training." <i>Id.,</i> at 398.</p>
<p>8. <i>The position of the American Bar Association.</i> At its 
meeting in February 1972 the ABA House of Delegates approved, with 17 
opposing votes, the Uniform Abortion Act that had been drafted and 
approved the preceding August by the Conference of Commissioners on 
Uniform State Laws. 58 A. B. A. J. 380 (1972). We set forth the Act in 
full in the margin.<sup>[40]</sup> The <span class="star-pagination">*147</span> Conference has appended an enlightening Prefatory Note.<sup>[41]</sup></p>
<p></p>
<h2>VII</h2>
<p>Three reasons have been advanced to explain historically the 
enactment of criminal abortion laws in the 19th century and to justify 
their continued existence.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*148</span> It has been argued 
occasionally that these laws were the product of a Victorian social 
concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct. Texas, however, does not 
advance this justification in the present case, and it appears that no 
court or commentator has taken the argument seriously.<sup>[42]</sup> The appellants and <i>amici</i>
 contend, moreover, that this is not a proper state purpose at all and 
suggest that, if it were, the Texas statutes are overbroad in protecting
 it since the law fails to distinguish between married and unwed 
mothers.</p>
<p>A second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical procedure. 
When most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a
 hazardous one for the woman.<sup>[43]</sup> This was particularly true prior to the <span class="star-pagination">*149</span>
 development of antisepsis. Antiseptic techniques, of course, were based
 on discoveries by Lister, Pasteur, and others first announced in 1867, 
but were not generally accepted and employed until about the turn of the
 century. Abortion mortality was high. Even after 1900, and perhaps 
until as late as the development of antibiotics in the 1940's, standard 
modern techniques such as dilation and curettage were not nearly so safe
 as they are today. Thus, it has been argued that a State's real concern
 in enacting a criminal abortion law was to protect the pregnant woman, 
that is, to restrain her from submitting to a procedure that placed her 
life in serious jeopardy.</p>
<p>Modern medical techniques have altered this situation. Appellants and various <i>amici</i>
 refer to medical data indicating that abortion in early pregnancy, that
 is, prior to the end of the first trimester, although not without its 
risk, is now relatively safe. Mortality rates for women undergoing early
 abortions, where the procedure is legal, appear to be as low as or 
lower than the rates for normal childbirth.<sup>[44]</sup> Consequently,
 any interest of the State in protecting the woman from an inherently 
hazardous procedure, except when it would be equally dangerous for her 
to forgo it, has largely disappeared. Of course, important state 
interests in the areas of health and medical standards do remain. <span class="star-pagination">*150</span>
 The State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like
 any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that 
insure maximum safety for the patient. This interest obviously extends 
at least to the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities 
involved, to the availability of after-care, and to adequate provision 
for any complication or emergency that might arise. The prevalence of 
high mortality rates at illegal "abortion mills" strengthens, rather 
than weakens, the State's interest in regulating the conditions under 
which abortions are performed. Moreover, the risk to the woman increases
 as her pregnancy continues. Thus, the State retains a definite interest
 in protecting the woman's own health and safety when an abortion is 
proposed at a late stage of pregnancy.</p>
<p>The third reason is the State's interestsome phrase it in terms of 
dutyin protecting prenatal life. Some of the argument for this 
justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from 
the moment of conception.<sup>[45]</sup> The State's interest and 
general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to 
prenatal life. Only when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at 
stake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should the 
interest of the embryo or fetus not prevail. Logically, of course, a 
legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on 
acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other
 point prior to live birth. In assessing the State's interest, 
recognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at 
least <i>potential</i> life is involved, the State may assert interests beyond the protection of the pregnant woman alone.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*151</span> Parties challenging state 
abortion laws have sharply disputed in some courts the contention that a
 purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to protect prenatal life.<sup>[46]</sup>
 Pointing to the absence of legislative history to support the 
contention, they claim that most state laws were designed solely to 
protect the woman. Because medical advances have lessened this concern, 
at least with respect to abortion in early pregnancy, they argue that 
with respect to such abortions the laws can no longer be justified by 
any state interest. There is some scholarly support for this view of 
original purpose.<sup>[47]</sup> The few state courts called upon to 
interpret their laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries did focus
 on the State's interest in protecting the woman's health rather than in
 preserving the embryo and fetus.<sup>[48]</sup> Proponents of this view point out that in many States, including Texas,<sup>[49]</sup>
 by statute or judicial interpretation, the pregnant woman herself could
 not be prosecuted for self-abortion or for cooperating in an abortion 
performed upon her by another.<sup>[50]</sup> They claim that adoption of the "quickening" distinction through received common <span class="star-pagination">*152</span>
 law and state statutes tacitly recognizes the greater health hazards 
inherent in late abortion and impliedly repudiates the theory that life 
begins at conception.</p>
<p>It is with these interests, and the weight to be attached to them, that this case is concerned.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>VIII</h2>
<p>The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In
 a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as <i>Union Pacific R. Co.</i> v. <i>Botsford,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="93149"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/93149/union-pacific-r-co-v-botsford/">141 U. S. 250</a></span>,
 251 (1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, 
or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under 
the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices 
have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First 
Amendment, <i>Stanley</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107898"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107898/stanley-v-georgia/">394 U.

S. 438</span>, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107082"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107082/griswold-v-connecticut/">381 U.

 399 (1923). These decisions make it clear that only personal rights 
that can be deemed "fundamental" or "implicit in the concept of ordered 
liberty," <i>Palko</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/">302 U. S. 319</a></span>,
 325 (1937), are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. They 
also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities 
relating to marriage, <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107480"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/">388 U.

<p>This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth 
Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state 
action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the 
Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough 
to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her 
pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant 
woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct
 harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. 
Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a 
distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental 
and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the 
distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and 
there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, 
psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in 
this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed 
motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her 
responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.</p>
<p>On the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some <i>amici</i>
 argue that the woman's right is absolute and that she is entitled to 
terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for 
whatever reason she alone chooses. With this we do not agree. 
Appellant's arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in 
regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to 
support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are 
unpersuasive. The <span class="star-pagination">*154</span> Court's 
decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some 
state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. As 
noted above, a State may properly assert important interests in 
safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting
 potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests 
become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that
 govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, 
cannot be said to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the 
claim asserted by some <i>amici</i> that one has an unlimited right to 
do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the 
right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions. The 
Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the 
past. <i>Jacobson</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="96230"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/96230/jacobson-v-massachusetts/">197 U.

<p>We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes 
the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must 
be considered against important state interests in regulation.</p>
<p>We note that those federal and state courts that have recently 
considered abortion law challenges have reached the same conclusion. A 
majority, in addition to the District Court in the present case, have 
held state laws unconstitutional, at least in part, because of vagueness
 or because of overbreadth and abridgment of rights. <i>Abele</i> v. <i>Markle,</i> <span class="citation no-link">342 F.

<p>Although the results are divided, most of these courts have agreed 
that the right of privacy, however based, is broad enough to cover the 
abortion decision; that the right, nonetheless, is not absolute and is 
subject to some limitations; and that at some point the state interests 
as to protection of health, medical standards, and prenatal life, become
 dominant. We agree with this approach.</p>
<p>Where certain "fundamental rights" are involved, the Court has held 
that regulation limiting these rights may be justified only by a 
"compelling state interest," <i>Kramer</i> v. <i>Union Free School District,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107971"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107971/kramer-v-union-free-school-dist-no-15/">395 U.

<p>In the recent abortion cases, cited above, courts have recognized 
these principles. Those striking down state laws have generally 
scrutinized the State's interests in protecting health and potential 
life, and have concluded that neither interest justified broad 
limitations on the reasons for which a physician and his pregnant 
patient might decide that she should have an abortion in the early 
stages of pregnancy. Courts sustaining state laws have held that the 
State's determinations to protect health or prenatal life are dominant 
and constitutionally justifiable.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>IX</h2>
<p>The District Court held that the appellee failed to meet his burden 
of demonstrating that the Texas statute's infringement upon Roe's rights
 was necessary to support a compelling state interest, and that, 
although the appellee presented "several compelling justifications for 
state presence in the area of abortions," the statutes outstripped these
 justifications and swept "far beyond any areas of compelling state 
interest." <span class="citation" data-id="1472349"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1472349/roe-v-wade/">314 F. Supp., at 1222-1223</a></span>.
 Appellant and appellee both contest that holding. Appellant, as has 
been indicated, claims an absolute right that bars any state imposition 
of criminal penalties in the area. Appellee argues that the State's 
determination to recognize and protect prenatal life from and after 
conception constitutes a compelling state interest. As noted above, we 
do not agree fully with either formulation.</p>
<p>A. The appellee and certain <i>amici</i> argue that the fetus is a 
"person" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In
 support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well-known 
facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is 
established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, <span class="star-pagination">*157</span>
 for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by 
the Amendment. The appellant conceded as much on reargument.<sup>[51]</sup> On the other hand, the appellee conceded on reargument<sup>[52]</sup> that no case could be cited that holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>The Constitution does not define "person" in so many words. Section 1
 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains three references to "person." The 
first, in defining "citizens," speaks of "persons born or naturalized in
 the United States." The word also appears both in the Due Process 
Clause and in the Equal Protection Clause. "Person" is used in other 
places in the Constitution: in the listing of qualifications for 
Representatives and Senators, Art. I, § 2, cl. 2, and § 3, cl. 3; in the
 Apportionment Clause, Art. I, § 2, cl. 3;<sup>[53]</sup> in the 
Migration and Importation provision, Art. I, § 9, cl. 1; in the 
Emolument Clause, Art. I, § 9, cl. 8; in the Electors provisions, Art. 
II, § 1, cl. 2, and the superseded cl. 3; in the provision outlining 
qualifications for the office of President, Art. II, § 1, cl. 5; in the 
Extradition provisions, Art. IV, § 2, cl. 2, and the superseded Fugitive
 Slave Clause 3; and in the Fifth, Twelfth, and Twenty-second 
Amendments, as well as in §§ 2 and 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But in
 nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has 
application only postnatally. None indicates, with any assurance, that 
it has any possible pre-natal application.<sup>[54]</sup></p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*158</span> All this, together with our observation, <i>supra,</i>
 that throughout the major portion of the 19th century prevailing legal 
abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that
 the word "person," as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not 
include the unborn.<sup>[55]</sup> This is in accord with the results reached in those few cases where the issue has been squarely presented. <i>McGarvey</i> v. <i>Magee-Womens Hospital,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="1445667"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1445667/mcgarvey-v-magee-womens-hospital/">340 F.

Indeed, our decision in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Vuitch,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108322"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108322/united-states-v-vuitch/">402 U. S. 62</a></span>
 (1971), inferentially is to the same effect, for we there would not 
have indulged in statutory interpretation favorable to abortion in 
specified circumstances if the necessary consequence was the termination
 of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.</p>
<p>This conclusion, however, does not of itself fully answer the 
contentions raised by Texas, and we pass on to other considerations.</p>
<p>B. The pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy. She carries 
an embryo and, later, a fetus, if one accepts the medical definitions of
 the developing young in the human uterus. See Dorland's Illustrated 
Medical Dictionary 478-479, 547 (24th ed. 1965). The situation therefore
 is inherently different from marital intimacy, or bedroom possession of
 obscene material, or marriage, or procreation, or education, with which
 <i>Eisenstadt</i> and <i>Griswold, Stanley, Loving, Skinner,</i> and <i>Pierce</i> and <i>Meyer</i>
 were respectively concerned. As we have intimated above, it is 
reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that at some point in 
time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential
 human life, becomes significantly involved. The woman's privacy is no 
longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured 
accordingly.</p>
<p>Texas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at
 conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, 
the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and 
after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when 
life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of 
medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any 
consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's 
knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*160</span> It should be sufficient to 
note briefly the wide divergence of thinking on this most sensitive and 
difficult question. There has always been strong support for the view 
that life does not begin until live birth. This was the belief of the 
Stoics.<sup>[56]</sup> It appears to be the predominant, though not the unanimous, attitude of the Jewish faith.<sup>[57]</sup>
 It may be taken to represent also the position of a large segment of 
the Protestant community, insofar as that can be ascertained; organized 
groups that have taken a formal position on the abortion issue have 
generally regarded abortion as a matter for the conscience of the 
individual and her family.<sup>[58]</sup> As we have noted, the common 
law found greater significance in quickening. Physicians and their 
scientific colleagues have regarded that event with less interest and 
have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon 
the interim point at which the fetus becomes "viable," that is, 
potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with 
artificial aid.<sup>[59]</sup> Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.<sup>[60]</sup>
 The Aristotelian theory of "mediate animation," that held sway 
throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Europe, continued to 
be official Roman Catholic dogma until the 19th century, despite 
opposition to this "ensoulment" theory from those in the Church who 
would recognize the existence of life from <span class="star-pagination">*161</span> the moment of conception.<sup>[61]</sup> The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the Catholic Church. As one brief <i>amicus</i>
 discloses, this is a view strongly held by many non-Catholics as well, 
and by many physicians. Substantial problems for precise definition of 
this view are posed, however, by new embryological data that purport to 
indicate that conception is a "process" over time, rather than an event,
 and by new medical techniques such as menstrual extraction, the 
"morning-after" pill, implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, 
and even artificial wombs.<sup>[62]</sup></p>
<p>In areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to 
endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live 
birth or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined
 situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth. 
For example, the traditional rule of tort law denied recovery for 
prenatal injuries even though the child was born alive.<sup>[63]</sup> 
That rule has been changed in almost every jurisdiction. In most States,
 recovery is said to be permitted only if the fetus was viable, or at 
least quick, when the injuries were sustained, though few <span class="star-pagination">*162</span> courts have squarely so held.<sup>[64]</sup>
 In a recent development, generally opposed by the commentators, some 
States permit the parents of a stillborn child to maintain an action for
 wrongful death because of prenatal injuries.<sup>[65]</sup> Such an 
action, however, would appear to be one to vindicate the parents' 
interest and is thus consistent with the view that the fetus, at most, 
represents only the potentiality of life. Similarly, unborn children 
have been recognized as acquiring rights or interests by way of 
inheritance or other devolution of property, and have been represented 
by guardians <i>ad litem.</i><sup>[66]</sup> Perfection of the interests
 involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In 
short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in 
the whole sense.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>X</h2>
<p>In view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one theory of 
life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at 
stake. We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and 
legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the 
pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident 
who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has 
still <i>another</i> important and legitimate interest in protecting the
 potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct. 
Each grows in substantiality as the woman approaches <span class="star-pagination">*163</span> term and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes "compelling."</p>
<p>With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in the 
health of the mother, the "compelling" point, in the light of present 
medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first trimester. 
This is so because of the now-established medical fact, referred to 
above at 149, that until the end of the first trimester mortality in 
abortion may be less than mortality in normal childbirth. It follows 
that, from and after this point, a State may regulate the abortion 
procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the 
preservation and protection of maternal health. Examples of permissible 
state regulation in this area are requirements as to the qualifications 
of the person who is to perform the abortion; as to the licensure of 
that person; as to the facility in which the procedure is to be 
performed, that is, whether it must be a hospital or may be a clinic or 
some other place of less-than-hospital status; as to the licensing of 
the facility; and the like.</p>
<p>This means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy 
prior to this "compelling" point, the attending physician, in 
consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation 
by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy 
should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the judgment may be 
effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State.</p>
<p>With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in 
potential life, the "compelling" point is at viability. This is so 
because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life 
outside the mother's womb. State regulation protective of fetal life 
after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If 
the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may
 go so far as to proscribe abortion <span class="star-pagination">*164</span> during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.</p>
<p>Measured against these standards, Art. 1196 of the Texas Penal Code, 
in restricting legal abortions to those "procured or attempted by 
medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother," sweeps
 too broadly. The statute makes no distinction between abortions 
performed early in pregnancy and those performed later, and it limits to
 a single reason, "saving" the mother's life, the legal justification 
for the procedure. The statute, therefore, cannot survive the 
constitutional attack made upon it here.</p>
<p>This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the 
additional challenge to the Texas statute asserted on grounds of 
vagueness. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Vuitch,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108322"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108322/united-states-v-vuitch/">402 U. S., at 67-72</a></span>.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>XI</h2>
<p>To summarize and to repeat:</p>
<p>1. A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a <i>life-saving</i>
 procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage 
and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of
 the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first 
trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to 
the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.</p>
<p>(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first 
trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the 
mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that
 are reasonably related to maternal health.</p>
<p>(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life <span class="star-pagination">*165</span>
 may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where
 it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation 
of the life or health of the mother.</p>
<p>2. The State may define the term "physician," as it has been employed
 in the preceding paragraphs of this Part XI of this opinion, to mean 
only a physician currently licensed by the State, and may proscribe any 
abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined.</p>
<p>In <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton</i><i>, post,</i> p. 179, procedural 
requirements contained in one of the modern abortion statutes are 
considered. That opinion and this one, of course, are to be read 
together.<sup>[67]</sup></p>
<p>This holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights of the
 respective interests involved, with the lessons and examples of medical
 and legal history, with the lenity of the common law, and with the 
demands of the profound problems of the present day. The decision leaves
 the State free to place increasing restrictions on abortion as the 
period of pregnancy lengthens, so long as those restrictions are 
tailored to the recognized state interests. The decision vindicates the 
right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his 
professional judgment up to the points where important <span class="star-pagination">*166</span>
 state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention. Up 
to those points, the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently,
 and primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must
 rest with the physician. If an individual practitioner abuses the 
privilege of exercising proper medical judgment, the usual remedies, 
judicial and intra-professional, are available.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>XII</h2>
<p>Our conclusion that Art. 1196 is unconstitutional means, of course, 
that the Texas abortion statutes, as a unit, must fall. The exception of
 Art. 1196 cannot be struck down separately, for then the State would be
 left with a statute proscribing all abortion procedures no matter how 
medically urgent the case.</p>
<p>Although the District Court granted appellant Roe declaratory relief,
 it stopped short of issuing an injunction against enforcement of the 
Texas statutes. The Court has recognized that different considerations 
enter into a federal court's decision as to declaratory relief, on the 
one hand, and injunctive relief, on the other. <i>Zwickler</i> v. <i>Koota,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107553"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107553/zwickler-v-koota/">389 U. S. 241</a></span>, 252-255 (1967); <i>Dombrowski</i> v. <i>Pfister,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107025"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107025/dombrowski-v-pfister/">380 U. S. 479</a></span>
 (1965). We are not dealing with a statute that, on its face, appears to
 abridge free expression, an area of particular concern under <i>Dombrowski</i> and refined in <i>Younger</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108263"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/">401 U. S., at 50</a></span>.</p>
<p>We find it unnecessary to decide whether the District Court erred in 
withholding injunctive relief, for we assume the Texas prosecutorial 
authorities will give full credence to this decision that the present 
criminal abortion statutes of that State are unconstitutional.</p>

<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.</p>
<p>In 1963, this Court, in <i>Ferguson</i> v. <i>Skrupa,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="106576"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/106576/ferguson-v-skrupa/">372 U. S. 726</a></span>,
 purported to sound the death knell for the doctrine of substantive due 
process, a doctrine under which many state laws had in the past been 
held to violate the Fourteenth Amendment. As Mr. Justice Black's opinion
 for the Court in <i>Skrupa</i> put it: "We have returned to the 
original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their 
social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who 
are elected to pass laws." <i>Id.,</i> at 730.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p>Barely two years later, in <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107082"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107082/griswold-v-connecticut/">381 U. S. 479</a></span>, the Court held a Connecticut birth control law unconstitutional. In view of what had been so recently said in <i>Skrupa,</i> the Court's opinion in <i>Griswold</i>
 understandably did its best to avoid reliance on the Due Process Clause
 of the Fourteenth Amendment as the ground for decision. Yet, the 
Connecticut law did not violate any provision of the Bill of Rights, nor
 any other specific provision of the Constitution.<sup>[2]</sup> So it was clear <span class="star-pagination">*168</span> to me then, and it is equally clear to me now, that the <i>Griswold</i>
 decision can be rationally understood only as a holding that the 
Connecticut statute substantively invaded the "liberty" that is 
protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup>[3]</sup> As so understood, <i>Griswold</i> stands as one in a long line of pre-<i>Skrupa</i> cases decided under the doctrine of substantive due process, and I now accept it as such.</p>
<p>"In a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of `liberty' must be broad indeed." <i>Board of Regents</i> v. <i>Roth,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108608"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/">408 U. S. 564</a></span>,
 572. The Constitution nowhere mentions a specific right of personal 
choice in matters of marriage and family life, but the "liberty" 
protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment covers 
more than those freedoms explicitly named in the Bill of Rights. See <i>Schware</i> v. <i>Board of Bar Examiners,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="105497"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/105497/schware-v-board-of-bar-examiners-of-nm/">353 U.

<p><span class="star-pagination">*169</span> As Mr. Justice Harlan once 
wrote: "[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process 
Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the 
specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This 
`liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the
 taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the 
right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and 
seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking,
 includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and 
purposeless restraints. . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable
 and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require 
particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify 
their abridgment." <i>Poe</i> v. <i>Ullman,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="106282"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/106282/poe-v-ullman/">367 U. S. 497</a></span>,
 543 (opinion dissenting from dismissal of appeal) (citations omitted). 
In the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, "Great concepts like . . . 
`liberty' . . . were purposely left to gather meaning from experience. 
For they relate to the whole domain of social and economic fact, and the
 statesmen who founded this Nation knew too well that only a stagnant 
society remains unchanged." <i>National Mutual Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Tidewater Transfer Co.,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="104697"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/104697/national-ins-co-v-tidewater-co/">337 U. S. 582</a></span>, 646 (dissenting opinion).</p>
<p>Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal 
choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties 
protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107480"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/">388 U.

As recently as last Term, in <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108489"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108489/eisenstadt-v-baird/">405 U.

 as the decision whether to bear or beget a child." That right 
necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to 
terminate her pregnancy. "Certainly the interests of a woman in giving 
of her physical and emotional self during pregnancy and the interests 
that will be affected throughout her life by the birth and raising of a 
child are of a far greater degree of significance and personal intimacy 
than the right to send a child to private school protected in Pierce v. 
Society of Sisters, <span class="citation" data-id="100694"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/100694/pierce-v-society-of-sisters/">268 U.

Nebraska, <span class="citation" data-id="100233"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/100233/meyer-v-nebraska/">262 U.

<p>Clearly, therefore, the Court today is correct in holding that the 
right asserted by Jane Roe is embraced within the personal liberty 
protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>It is evident that the Texas abortion statute infringes that right 
directly. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more complete abridgment 
of a constitutional freedom than that worked by the inflexible criminal 
statute now in force in Texas. The question then becomes whether the 
state interests advanced to justify this abridgment can survive the 
"particularly careful scrutiny" that the Fourteenth Amendment here 
requires.</p>
<p>The asserted state interests are protection of the health and safety 
of the pregnant woman, and protection of the potential future human life
 within her. These are legitimate objectives, amply sufficient to permit
 a State to regulate abortions as it does other surgical procedures, and
 perhaps sufficient to permit a State to regulate abortions more 
stringently or even to prohibit them in the late stages of pregnancy. 
But such legislation is not before us, and I think the Court today has 
thoroughly demonstrated that these state interests cannot 
constitutionally support the broad abridgment of personal <span class="star-pagination">*171</span>
 liberty worked by the existing Texas law. Accordingly, I join the 
Court's opinion holding that that law is invalid under the Due Process 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.</p>
<p>The Court's opinion brings to the decision of this troubling question
 both extensive historical fact and a wealth of legal scholarship. While
 the opinion thus commands my respect, I find myself nonetheless in 
fundamental disagreement with those parts of it that invalidate the 
Texas statute in question, and therefore dissent.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>The Court's opinion decides that a State may impose virtually no 
restriction on the performance of abortions during the first trimester 
of pregnancy. Our previous decisions indicate that a necessary predicate
 for such an opinion is a plaintiff who was in her first trimester of 
pregnancy at some time during the pendency of her law-suit. While a 
party may vindicate his own constitutional rights, he may not seek 
vindication for the rights of others. <i>Moose Lodge</i> v. <i>Irvis,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108572"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108572/moose-lodge-no-107-v-irvis/">407 U. S. 163</a></span> (1972); <i>Sierra Club</i> v. <i>Morton,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108502"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108502/sierra-club-v-morton/">405 U. S. 727</a></span>
 (1972). The Court's statement of facts in this case makes clear, 
however, that the record in no way indicates the presence of such a 
plaintiff. We know only that plaintiff Roe at the time of filing her 
complaint was a pregnant woman; for aught that appears in this record, 
she may have been in her <i>last</i> trimester of pregnancy as of the date the complaint was filed.</p>
<p>Nothing in the Court's opinion indicates that Texas might not 
constitutionally apply its proscription of abortion as written to a 
woman in that stage of pregnancy. Nonetheless, the Court uses her 
complaint against the Texas statute as a fulcrum for deciding that 
States may <span class="star-pagination">*172</span> impose virtually no restrictions on medical abortions performed during the <i>first</i>
 trimester of pregnancy. In deciding such a hypothetical lawsuit, the 
Court departs from the longstanding admonition that it should never 
"formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the 
precise facts to which it is to be applied." <i>Liverpool, New York &amp; Philadelphia S. S. Co.</i> v. <i>Commissioners of Emigration,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="91256"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/91256/steamship-co-v-emigration-commissioners/">113 U. S. 33</a></span>, 39 (1885). See also <i>Ashwander</i> v. <i>TVA,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="102605"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/102605/ashwander-v-tva/">297 U. S. 288</a></span>, 345 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>Even if there were a plaintiff in this case capable of litigating the
 issue which the Court decides, I would reach a conclusion opposite to 
that reached by the Court. I have difficulty in concluding, as the Court
 does, that the right of "privacy" is involved in this case. Texas, by 
the statute here challenged, bars the performance of a medical abortion 
by a licensed physician on a plaintiff such as Roe. A transaction 
resulting in an operation such as this is not "private" in the ordinary 
usage of that word. Nor is the "privacy" that the Court finds here even a
 distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by
 the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred 
to as embodying a right to privacy. <i>Katz</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="107564"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107564/katz-v-united-states/">389 U. S. 347</a></span> (1967).</p>
<p>If the Court means by the term "privacy" no more than that the claim 
of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of consensual 
transactions may be a form of "liberty" protected by the Fourteenth 
Amendment, there is no doubt that similar claims have been upheld in our
 earlier decisions on the basis of that liberty. I agree with the 
statement of MR. JUSTICE STEWART in his concurring opinion that the 
"liberty," against deprivation of which without due process the 
Fourteenth <span class="star-pagination">*173</span> Amendment protects,
 embraces more than the rights found in the Bill of Rights. But that 
liberty is not guaranteed absolutely against deprivation, only against 
deprivation without due process of law. The test traditionally applied 
in the area of social and economic legislation is whether or not a law 
such as that challenged has a rational relation to a valid state 
objective. <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical Co.,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="105285"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/105285/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-okla-inc/">348 U. S. 483</a></span>,
 491 (1955). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 
undoubtedly does place a limit, albeit a broad one, on legislative power
 to enact laws such as this. If the Texas statute were to prohibit an 
abortion even where the mother's life is in jeopardy, I have little 
doubt that such a statute would lack a rational relation to a valid 
state objective under the test stated in <i>Williamson, supra</i><i>.</i>
 But the Court's sweeping invalidation of any restrictions on abortion 
during the first trimester is impossible to justify under that standard,
 and the conscious weighing of competing factors that the Court's 
opinion apparently substitutes for the established test is far more 
appropriate to a legislative judgment than to a judicial one.</p>
<p>The Court eschews the history of the Fourteenth Amendment in its reliance on the "compelling state interest" test. See <i>Weber</i> v. <i>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="108527"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108527/weber-v-aetna-casualty-surety-co/">406 U. S. 164</a></span>,
 179 (1972) (dissenting opinion). But the Court adds a new wrinkle to 
this test by transposing it from the legal considerations associated 
with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this 
case arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
Unless I misapprehend the consequences of this transplanting of the 
"compelling state interest test," the Court's opinion will accomplish 
the seemingly impossible feat of leaving this area of the law more 
confused than it found it.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*174</span> While the Court's opinion quotes from the dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes in <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="96276"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/96276/lochner-v-new-york/">198 U. S. 45</a></span>, 74 (1905), the result it reaches is more closely attuned to the majority opinion of Mr. Justice Peckham in that case. As in <i>Lochner</i>
 and similar cases applying substantive due process standards to 
economic and social welfare legislation, the adoption of the compelling 
state interest standard will inevitably require this Court to examine 
the legislative policies and pass on the wisdom of these policies in the
 very process of deciding whether a particular state interest put 
forward may or may not be "compelling." The decision here to break 
pregnancy into three distinct terms and to outline the permissible 
restrictions the State may impose in each one, for example, partakes 
more of judicial legislation than it does of a determination of the 
intent of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>The fact that a majority of the States reflecting, after all, the 
majority sentiment in those States, have had restrictions on abortions 
for at least a century is a strong indication, it seems to me, that the 
asserted right to an abortion is not "so rooted in the traditions and 
conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental," <i>Snyder</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="102189"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/102189/snyder-v-massachusetts/">291 U. S. 97</a></span>,
 105 (1934). Even today, when society's views on abortion are changing, 
the very existence of the debate is evidence that the "right" to an 
abortion is not so universally accepted as the appellant would have us 
believe.</p>
<p>To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the
 scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently 
completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, 
the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the 
Connecticut Legislature. Conn. Stat., Tit. 22, §§ 14, 16. By the time of
 the adoption of the Fourteenth <span class="star-pagination">*175</span> Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion.<sup>[1]</sup> While many States have amended or updated <span class="star-pagination">*176</span> their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.<sup>[2]</sup> Indeed, the Texas statute struck down today was, as the majority notes, first enacted in 1857 <span class="star-pagination">*177</span> and "has remained substantially unchanged to the present time." <i>Ante,</i> at 119.</p>
<p>There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this 
provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth 
Amendment was adopted. The only conclusion possible from this history is
 that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment 
withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this 
matter.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>Even if one were to agree that the case that the Court decides were 
here, and that the enunciation of the substantive constitutional law in 
the Court's opinion were proper, the actual disposition of the case by 
the Court is still difficult to justify. The Texas statute is struck 
down <i>in toto,</i> even though the Court apparently concedes that at 
later periods of pregnancy Texas might impose these selfsame statutory 
limitations on abortion. My understanding of past practice is that a 
statute found <span class="star-pagination">*178</span> to be invalid as
 applied to a particular plaintiff, but not unconstitutional as a whole,
 is not simply "struck down" but is, instead, declared unconstitutional 
as applied to the fact situation before the Court. <i>Yick Wo</i> v. <i>Hopkins,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="91704"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/">118 U.

S. 576</a></span> (1969).</p>
<p>For all of the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p>[3]  Long ago, a suggestion was made that the Texas statutes were 
unconstitutionally vague because of definitional deficiencies. The Texas
 Court of Criminal Appeals disposed of that suggestion peremptorily, 
saying only,
</p>
<p>"It is also insisted in the motion in arrest of judgment that the 
statute is unconstitutional and void in that it does not sufficiently 
define or describe the offense of abortion. We do not concur in respect 
to this question." <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>State,</i> <span class="citation" data-id="3981079"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4208886/jackson-v-state/">55 Tex. Cr.

<p>The same court recently has held again that the State's abortion statutes are not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>
 (Ct. Crim. App. Tex. 1971), appeal docketed, No. 71-1200. The court 
held that "the State of Texas has a compelling interest to protect fetal
 life"; that Art. 1191 "is designed to protect fetal life"; that the 
Texas homicide statutes, particularly Art. 1205 of the Penal Code, are 
intended to protect a person "in existence by actual birth" and thereby 
implicitly recognize other human life that is not "in existence by 
actual birth"; that the definition of human life is for the legislature 
and not the courts; that Art. 1196 "is more definite than the District 
of Columbia statute upheld in [<i>United States</i> v.] <i>Vuitch</i>" (<span class="citation" data-id="108322"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108322/united-states-v-vuitch/">402 U. S. 62</a></span>); and that the Texas statute "is not vague and indefinite or overbroad." A physician's abortion conviction was affirmed.</p>
<p>In <i>Thompson,</i> n. 2, the court observed that any issue as to the burden of proof under the exemption of Art. 1196 "is not before us." But see <i>Veevers</i> v. <i>State,</i> <span class="citation no-link">172 Tex. Cr.

the District Court was held on July 22, 1970. Brief for Appellee 13. The
 docket entries, App. 2, and the transcript, App. 76, reveal this to be

<p>[7]  We need not consider what different result, if any, would follow
 if Dr. Hallford's intervention were on behalf of a class. His complaint
 in intervention does not purport to assert a class suit and makes no 
reference to any class apart from an allegation that he "and others 
similarly situated" must necessarily guess at the meaning of Art. 1196. 
His application for leave to intervene goes somewhat further, for it 
asserts that plaintiff Roe does not adequately protect the interest of 
the doctor "and the class of people who are physicians . . . [and] the 
class of people who are . . . patients . . . ." The leave application, 
however, is not the complaint. Despite the District Court's statement to
 the contrary, <span class="citation" data-id="1472349"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1472349/roe-v-wade/">314 F. Supp., at 1225</a></span>, we fail to perceive the essentials of a class suit in the Hallford complaint.</p>

<p>[22]  Early philosophers believed that the embryo or fetus did not 
become formed and begin to live until at least 40 days after conception 
for a male, and 80 to 90 days for a female. See, for example, Aristotle,
 Hist. Anim. 7.3.583b; Gen. Anim. 2.3.736, 2.5.741; Hippocrates, Lib. de
 Nat. Puer., No. 10. Aristotle's thinking derived from his three-stage 
theory of life: vegetable, animal, rational. The vegetable stage was 
reached at conception, the animal at "animation," and the rational soon 
after live birth. This theory, together with the 40/80 day view, came to
 be accepted by early Christian thinkers.
</p>
<p>The theological debate was reflected in the writings of St. Augustine, who made a distinction between <i>embryo inanimatus,</i> not yet endowed with a soul, and <i>embryo animatus.</i>
 He may have drawn upon Exodus 21:22. At one point, however, he 
expressed the view that human powers cannot determine the point during 
fetal development at which the critical change occurs. See Augustine, De
 Origine Animae 4.4 (Pub. Law 44.527). See also W. Reany, The Creation 
of the Human Soul, c. 2 and 83-86 (1932); Huser, The Crime of Abortion 
in Canon Law 15 (Catholic Univ. of America, Canon Law Studies No. 162, 
Washington, D. C., 1942).</p>
<p>Galen, in three treatises related to embryology, accepted the 
thinking of Aristotle and his followers. Quay 426-427. Later, Augustine 
on abortion was incorporated by Gratian into the Decretum, published 
about 1140. Decretum Magistri Gratiani 2.32.2.7 to 2.32.2.10, in 1 
Corpus Juris Canonici 1122, 1123 (A. Friedburg, 2d ed. 1879). This 
Decretal and the Decretals that followed were recognized as the 
definitive body of canon law until the new Code of 1917.</p>
<p>For discussions of the canon-law treatment, see Means I, pp. 411-412;
 Noonan 20-26; Quay 426-430; see also J. Noonan, Contraception: A 
History of Its Treatment by the Catholic Theologians and Canonists 18-29
 (1965).</p>
<p>[23]  Bracton took the position that abortion by blow or poison was 
homicide "if the foetus be already formed and animated, and particularly
 if it be animated." 2 H. Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae
 279 (T. Twiss ed. 1879), or, as a later translation puts it, "if the 
foetus is already formed or quickened, especially if it is quickened," 2
 H. Bracton, On the Laws and Customs of England 341 (S. Thorne ed. 
1968). See Quay 431; see also 2 Fleta 60-61 (Book 1, c. 23) (Selden 
Society ed. 1955).</p>

Ninth-Amendment Right About to Arise from the Nineteenth-Century 
Legislative Ashes of a Fourteenth-Century Common-Law Liberty?, 17 N. Y. 
L. F. 335 (1971) (hereinafter Means II). The author examines the two 
principal precedents cited marginally by Coke, both contrary to his 
dictum, and traces the treatment of these and other cases by earlier 
commentators. He concludes that Coke, who himself participated as an 
advocate in an abortion case in 1601, may have intentionally misstated 
the law. The author even suggests a reason: Coke's strong feelings 
against abortion, coupled with his determination to assert common-law 
(secular) jurisdiction to assess penalties for an offense that 
traditionally had been an exclusively ecclesiastical or canon-law crime.
 See also Lader 78-79, who notes that some scholars doubt that the 
common law ever was applied to abortion; that the English ecclesiastical
 courts seem to have lost interest in the problem after 1527; and that 
the preamble to the English legislation of 1803, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, § 1, 
referred to in the text, <i>infra,</i> at 136, states that "no adequate means have been hitherto provided for the prevention and punishment of such offenses."</p>

<p>By the end of 1970, four other States had repealed criminal penalties
 for abortions performed in early pregnancy by a licensed physician, 
subject to stated procedural and health requirements. <span class="citation no-link">Alaska Stat. § 11.15.060</span> (1970); <span class="citation no-link">Haw. Rev.

 to 9.02.080 (Supp. 1972). The precise status of criminal abortion laws 
in some States is made unclear by recent decisions in state and federal 
courts striking down existing state laws, in whole or in part.</p>
<p>[38]  "Whereas, Abortion, like any other medical procedure, should 
not be performed when contrary to the best interests of the patient 
since good medical practice requires due consideration for the patient's
 welfare and not mere acquiescence to the patient's demand; and
</p>
<p>"Whereas, The standards of sound clinical judgment, which, together 
with informed patient consent should be determinative according to the 
merits of each individual case; therefore be it</p>
<p>"<i>RESOLVED,</i> That abortion is a medical procedure and should be 
performed only by a duly licensed physician and surgeon in an accredited
 hospital acting only after consultation with two other physicians 
chosen because of their professional competency and in conformance with 
standards of good medical practice and the Medical Practice Act of his 
State; and be it further</p>
<p>"<i>RESOLVED,</i> That no physician or other professional personnel 
shall be compelled to perform any act which violates his good medical 
judgment. Neither physician, hospital, nor hospital personnel shall be 
required to perform any act violative of personally-held moral 
principles. In these circumstances good medical practice requires only 
that the physician or other professional personnel withdraw from the 
case so long as the withdrawal is consistent with good medical 
practice." Proceedings of the AMA House of Delegates 220 (June 1970).</p>
<p>[39]  "The Principles of Medical Ethics of the AMA do not prohibit a 
physician from performing an abortion that is performed in accordance 
with good medical practice and under circumstances that do not violate 
the laws of the community in which he practices.

</p>
<p>"SECTION 1. [<i>Abortion Defined; When Authorized.</i>]</p>
<p>"(a) `Abortion' means the termination of human pregnancy with an 
intention other than to produce a live birth or to remove a dead fetus.</p>
<p>"(b) An abortion may be performed in this state only if it is performed:</p>
<p>"(1) by a physician licensed to practice medicine [or osteopathy] in 
this state or by a physician practicing medicine [or osteopathy] in the 
employ of the government of the United States or of this state, [and the
 abortion is performed [in the physician's office or in a medical 
clinic, or] in a hospital approved by the [Department of Health] or 
operated by the United States, this state, or any department, agency, or
 political subdivision of either;] or by a female upon herself upon the 
advice of the physician; and</p>
<p>"(2) within [20] weeks after the commencement of the pregnancy [or 
after [20] weeks only if the physician has reasonable cause to believe 
(i) there is a substantial risk that continuance of the pregnancy would 
endanger the life of the mother or would gravely impair the physical or 
mental health of the mother, (ii) that the child would be born with 
grave physical or mental defect, or (iii) that the pregnancy resulted 
from rape or incest, or illicit intercourse with a girl under the age of
 16 years].</p>
<p>"SECTION 2. [<i>Penalty.</i>] Any person who performs or procures an 
abortion other than authorized by this Act is guilty of a [felony] and, 
upon conviction thereof, may be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding 
[$1,000] or to imprisonment [in the state penitentiary] not exceeding [5
 years], or both.</p>
<p>"SECTION 3. [<i>Uniformity of Interpretation.</i>] This Act shall be 
construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with
 respect to the subject of this Act among those states which enact it.</p>
<p>"SECTION 4. [<i>Short Title.</i>] This Act may be cited as the Uniform Abortion Act.</p>
<p>"SECTION 5. [<i>Severability.</i>] If any provision of this Act or 
the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, 
the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this 
Act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or 
application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.</p>
<p>"SECTION 6. [<i>Repeal.</i>] The following acts and parts of acts are repealed:</p>
<p>"(1)</p>
<p>"(2)</p>
<p>"(3)</p>
<p>"SECTION 7. [<i>Time of Taking Effect.</i>] This Act shall take effect________________."</p>
<p>[41]  "This Act is based largely upon the New York abortion act 
following a review of the more recent laws on abortion in several states
 and upon recognition of a more liberal trend in laws on this subject. 
Recognition was given also to the several decisions in state and federal
 courts which show a further trend toward liberalization of abortion 
laws, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy.
</p>
<p>"Recognizing that a number of problems appeared in New York, a 
shorter time period for `unlimited' abortions was advisable. The time 
period was bracketed to permit the various states to insert a figure 
more in keeping with the different conditions that might exist among the
 states. Likewise, the language limiting the place or places in which 
abortions may be performed was also bracketed to account for different 
conditions among the states. In addition, limitations on abortions after
 the initial `unlimited' period were placed in brackets so that 
individual states may adopt all or any of these reasons, or place 
further restrictions upon abortions after the initial period.</p>
<p>"This Act does not contain any provision relating to medical review 
committees or prohibitions against sanctions imposed upon medical 
personnel refusing to participate in abortions because of religious or 
other similar reasons, or the like. Such provisions, while related, do 
not directly pertain to when, where, or by whom abortions may be 
performed; however, the Act is not drafted to exclude such a provision 
by a state wishing to enact the same."</p>

 144 (1949). A short discussion of the modern law on this issue is 
contained in the Comment to the ALI's Model Penal Code § 207.11, at 158 
and nn. 35-37 (Tent. Draft No. 9, 1959).</p>

<p>[53]  We are not aware that in the taking of any census under this clause, a fetus has ever been counted.</p>
<p>[54]  When Texas urges that a fetus is entitled to Fourteenth 
Amendment protection as a person, it faces a dilemma. Neither in Texas 
nor in any other State are all abortions prohibited. Despite broad 
proscription, an exception always exists. The exception contained in 
Art. 1196, for an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for 
the purpose of saving the life of the mother, is typical. But if the 
fetus is a person who is not to be deprived of life without due process 
of law, and if the mother's condition is the sole determinant, does not 
the Texas exception appear to be out of line with the Amendment's 
command?
</p>
<p>There are other inconsistencies between Fourteenth Amendment status 
and the typical abortion statute. It has already been pointed out, n. 
49, <i>supra,</i> that in Texas the woman is not a principal or an 
accomplice with respect to an abortion upon her. If the fetus is a 
person, why is the woman not a principal or an accomplice? Further, the 
penalty for criminal abortion specified by Art. 1195 is significantly 
less than the maximum penalty for murder prescribed by Art. 1257 of the 
Texas Penal Code. If the fetus is a person, may the penalties be 
different?</p>
<p>[55]  Cf. the Wisconsin abortion statute, defining "unborn child" to 
mean "a human being from the time of conception until it is born alive,"
 <span class="citation no-link">Wis. Stat. § 940.04</span> (6) (1969), 
and the new Connecticut Statute, Pub. Act No. 1 (May 1972 special 
session), declaring it to be the public policy of the State and the 
legislative intent "to protect and preserve human life from the moment 
of conception."</p>

<p>[67]  Neither in this opinion nor in <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton</i><i>, post,</i>
 p. 179, do we discuss the father's rights, if any exist in the 
constitutional context, in the abortion decision. No paternal right has 
been asserted in either of the cases, and the Texas and the Georgia 
statutes on their face take no cognizance of the father. We are aware 
that some statutes recognize the father under certain circumstances. 
North Carolina, for example, N. C. Gen. Stat. § 14-45.1 (Supp. 1971), 
requires written permission for the abortion from the husband when the 
woman is a married minor, that is, when she is less than 18 years of 
age, 41 N. C. A. G. 489 (1971); if the woman is an unmarried minor, 
written permission from the parents is required. We need not now decide 
whether provisions of this kind are constitutional.</p>
<p>[1]  Only Mr. Justice Harlan failed to join the Court's opinion, <span class="citation" data-id="106576"><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/106576/ferguson-v-skrupa/">372 U. S., at 733</a></span>.</p>
<p>[2]  There is no constitutional right of privacy, as such. "[The 
Fourth] Amendment protects individual privacy against certain kinds of 
governmental intrusion, but its protections go further, and often have 
nothing to do with privacy at all. Other provisions of the Constitution 
protect personal privacy from other forms of governmental invasion. But 
the protection of a person's <i>general</i> right to privacyhis right 
to be let alone by other peopleis, like the protection of his property 
and of his very life, left largely to the law of the individual States."
